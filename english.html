    <p>On air: Mitiarjuk Attasie Nappaaluk reads from the original inuktitut version of Sanaaq. Excerpt from the audio archives of Bernard Saladin d’Anglure, 1970.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>English transcription :</p>
    <p>“Kajualuk was choking and I tried to get the bone out by getting it to gulp down the pieces of blubber I still had… That was all I had left of my provisions… A bit longer and the dog would’ve been a goner. For a long timer after, it would whimper while I was making tea, because of the bone that had been stuck in its throat.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Her daughter was curious. “Mother, was it our big dog?”</p>
    <p>“Yes!”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Qumaq began to chatter “<em>Taka taka taka</em>…” while playing on the sleeping platform. Her mother knew it was bedtime.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Daughter, I’ll help you undress and you’ll go to bed. It’s now quite late… I’ll take your boots off. <em>Iii</em>! My, my, they’re soaking wet! My girl is really getting around! She just got those boots! I’ll soak a piece of leather for you to make a new sole. I’ll let it soak overnight.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She put a piece in a plate to soak. Qumaq undressed for bed, talking all the while. “Mother <em>ai</em>! <em>Apaapa</em>! I’d like to eat some black crowberries!”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Take a few, but that’s all for today. I don’t want you getting sick to your stomach!”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Yes! By the way, Mother, I don’t have a daddy, do I?”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Being just a child, she said whatever crossed her mind. Her mother answered, “No, it’s true, you don’t. Long ago your father died, a very long time ago. We’ll see him only in the hereafter… Long ago he fell into the water while travelling far away… He often told us to behave properly. So you too will try to behave yourself!”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“<em>Ai</em>! He died what I was very little!”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mother and daughter had finished talking to each other and tried to go to sleep. But no sooner had Qumaq fallen asleep than she began to sleepwalk. She stood up and walked, sobbing, “Mother, carry me on your back… Let’s both go walking…”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sanaaq reached out and pulled her daughter close, to put her back to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
